# AGILE 


What is Agile – A set of principles and values, which can help develop methods and process such as SCRUM/KANBAN/TDD/SPRINT/LEAN/BDD/CAM/FDD. MINDSET INSPIRED BY THE MANIFESTO AND

Origin of Agile

Software developers in the 80s and 90s experienced high levels of failed projects & noticed some common traits;(V-model, Waterfall)

-	Too much Analysis upfront
-	Restrictive change control
-	Too much uncertainty
Values and Principles
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:
Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.
TIME COST QUALITY SCOPE




1.	Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2.	Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3.	Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4.	Businesspeople and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5.	Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done.
6.	The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7.	Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8.	Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9.	Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
10.	Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11.	The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12.	At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.












Agile & Scrum Overview


SCRUM FRAMEWORK





Scrum Competencies

-	Empiricism means working in an experience and evidence-based manner, so progress is based on reality
-	3 Pillars: Transparency, Inspection and Adaptation
Transparency – Facts as is
Inspection – Everyone Inspects
Adaptation – Reflect and Improve

Product Owner -Key Stakeholder who should have deep understanding of the products and communicates with both the team and other stakeholders
Scrum Master -Ensures the team keeps the values of Scrum facilitates meetings and removes impediments
Scrum Team: 3-9 People/ All doing what it takes to complete the agreed tasks/ Everyone is not just committed but they are all involved.

THE SPRINT – Planning and Development Work, Limited to one month, No changes that endanger sprint goal.
Sprint Planning – What can be delivered , How will the work be done, Limited to 8 hours for a month .
Daily Scrum – Optimise team collaboration (Stand-up ETC)
Sprint Review - 4 Hours a month, Review of what has been done
Sprint Retrospective – From the Review, what can be done better and create a plan for improvements. 3 Hours a month.


Scrum Artefacts
Product Backlog – Contains all the stories to be done to complete the entire product
Sprint Backlog – Contains the stories to be worked on in the current sprint
Increment –

Information Radiators
Task Board – Used to track the work visually, showing the state of the sprint for the Team and Stakeholders
Burn Up Chart – Used to track the team’s velocity, Work Completed x Time
Burn Down Chart – Used to track teams’ velocity, Work Remaining x Time
Definition of Done – Shared agreement of what constitutes as ‘done’ for any story
Different from acceptance criteria


Retrospectives

The Goal

-	Identify a few specific things to improve and create an action plan for how to implement them (SMART GOAL)
The Agenda

-	Set the Stage – Everyone is able to speak freely
-	Gather Data – On what happened during the sprint, TimeLine or Mood graph.
-	Generate Insights – Find out what it means/ find patterns / Deepen Understanding
-	Decide What to Do – Based on greatest value
-	Close the Retro - Summarize action plan and enthuse everyone.

User Story , Backlog and Estimation

-Features, Epics and User stories
-User Personas
-How to worte a use storie
-Prioritising backlog
-Estimation techniques

As a [type of user] , I want [goal] so that [reason]
User stories do not include all the detail they are only a pointer to the real requirement.

FEATURE – Secure Login
EPIC – As a customer I need to login with security
USER STORIES – ‘Need a registration form so I can access the system’ /’Need a login form So that I can enter my credentials’/’Need a link to reset my password So I can access the system if forget my credentials’
